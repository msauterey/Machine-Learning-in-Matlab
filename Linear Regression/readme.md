# Linear Regression


## Simple Linear Regression model

Implementation of linear regression with one variable to predict profits for a food truck given data for profits and populations from cities.

Plot of the data and fitted linear regression line for one independent variable.

Surface plot of the cost function varying with changes in estimated regression parameters and eventually reaching a global minimum to provide the optimal parameters.

Contour plot of the cost function varying with changes in estimated regression parameters and eventually reaching a global minimum to provide the optimal parameters. Each step of the gradient descent goes moves towards the minimum.

## Multivariate Linear Regression model

Implementation of linear regression with multiple variables to predict house prices in Portland, OR given two features: the size of the house and the number of bedrooms.

Plot of the cost function J versus number of iterations during a gradient descent. The cost function converges to a minimum after an appropriate learning rate was chosen.
